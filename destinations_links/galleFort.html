                            The Galle Fort, located on the southern coast of the country, is one of the five historical monuments which one must
                             visit when in Sri Lanka. The fort was initially built by the Portuguese and was later modified by the Dutch. Today
                              the Galle Fort is also declared as a UNESCO World Heritage site and is a stunning blend of architecture, archaeology 
                              and history amidst a beautiful tropical setting
                     </p>
                        <p>The Galle Fort attracts many tourists and locals not just because of its historical appeal but the buzzing life inside
                             the monument with lively shops and cafes, museums, villas and lifestyle shops to complete your experience. You can visit
                              all these places by taking a walk through the beautiful structures, which is always open and also free of cost. If you
                               have some extra time to spare, do go through the walls by the perimeter, where you will find several stairs which will
                                lead you up to it.
                        </p>
                     <p>
                        The modern history of the Galle Fort begins from the year 1502. At this time, a small fleet of Portuguese ships arrived which were 
                        swayed off by the storm. Since then, the fort was managed by the Portuguese and used as a prison camp for the Sinhalese who went against
                         them. Later, the Portuguese were attacked by the Dutch who took over the city and made the Galle Fort with sand, mud, and palm trees.
                      </p>
                     <p> 
                        The fort was later taken over by the British in the year 1796 after they captured the capital city of Colombo and it remained under
                         the British rule until the country got independence in the year 1948.  Further, the importance of Galle as a city also reduced after
                          the British declared Colombo as the capital.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        The Fort really resembles a small laid out walled town, with a rectangular grid pattern of streets full of the low houses with gables
                         and verandas in the Dutch colonial style. The fort area also has a number of historic churches, mosques, museums, commercial and
                          government buildings. One can take an exciting walk through this heritage site and observe the many sites such as the Old Gate with
                           the British Coat-of-Arms inscribed on it, the Old Dutch Hospital, the ramparts that run around the fortress, the clock tower built
                            in 1882, the light house built in 1939, the Dutch colonial-style houses with gables and verandahs, the Dutch Reformed Church built
                             in 1640, the New Oriental Hotel built-in 1694, the National Maritime Museum and many bastions - each made for a specific purpose. 
                             Visitors can also visit Galle Vegetable and Fish Market situated in the city center.
