                            At a distance of 80 km from Galle, Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a forest reserve and a biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka. It is one of the very few virgin rainforests in the world and among the prime places to visit in Sri Lanka for nature lovers. 
                     </p>
                        <p>Sinharaja is the last viable area of primary tropical rainforest in Sri Lanka. More than 60% of the trees are endemic and many of them are considered rare. The hilly virgin rainforest, part of the Sri Lanka lowland rain forests ecoregion, was saved from the worst of commercial logging by its inaccessibility. This reserve was once a royal reserve and in some colonial records, it is referred to as Rajasinghe Forest. It was designated a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988. The reserve's name translates as the Lion Kingdom.
                        </p>
                     <p>
                        The reserve is only 21 km from east to west, and a maximum of 7 km from north to south, but it is home to over 50% of Sri Lanka's endemic species of mammals and butterflies as well as many kinds of insects, rare amphibians and reptiles. Due to its dense vegetation, not many animals and birds are seen as it is in other forest reserves and national parks. There are about 3 elephants and 15 leopards. The most common larger mammal is the endemic purple-faced langur. Also, the Sinharaja Forest Reserve is home to more than 30 species of birds that are endemic to Sri Lanka along with many species of migratory birds. There are 22 villages around the forest, and the local people are permitted to enter the rainforest to collect dead wood and leaves for fuel and other uses. They are also allowed to collect medicinal plants during certain seasons.
                      </p>
                     <p> 
                        There are tons of things to do at this beautiful wet reserve like bird watching, animal sightseeing, hiking and seeing the vivid gorgeous waterfalls. The two main nature trails of Sinharaja Rain Forest are those lead to the peak of Moulawella and the peak of Sinhagala. Both of these nature trails begins at Kudawa Conservation Centre (KCC) are equally enjoyable and enlightening. Small streams of crystal-clear cool water, that is home to a variety of fish, toads, and crabs, crisscross the trails. Also, there are several places to visit near Sinharaja Forest Reserve such as the Kolawenigama Temple, and Kiruwananaganga Falls, one of the most significant falls in the country that can be visited on a jeep. One can also visit the Gatabaruwa Temple that stands atop a small hill in the forest and can be reached on foot or by car. The temple has beautiful architecture and provides a great view of the forest below.
                    </p>
                        <p>The forest reserve has three entry gates- the Kudawa entrance, which is the main and most used, the Pitadeniya entrance, and the least-used Morning Side entrance. Visitors need a permit to enter the forest area. It can be obtained from the entry gates along with the entry ticket. An ID card or passport will be required to obtain entry. One might need a guide which can be hired from Kudawa or Weddagala, which is en-route to Kudawa when coming from Kalawana. The rain forest is not suitable for vehicle tours, so visitors will travel on foot. It is recommended to bring boots as the park is a common environment for leeches and venomous snakes.</p>
